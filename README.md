### The One-Word Word Processor

*What if Word did what the name suggests?*

---

Meet **Werd** — a word processor that allows exactly one word.

It sits there. One document. One word. Staring at a blinking cursor that begs for more, but Werd holds firm. *"One word,"* it whispers. *"That's all you get."*

Microsoft Word lets you write novels, dissertations, angry emails to your landlord. Werd lets you write... a word. Just one. You want more? Too bad. One word is all you need.

*"Maybe if I just —"* you think. *"Maybe then I can express myself."*

You can't. One word. The way nature intended.

## Features

All the features of a regular word processor, experienced one word at a time:

- **One Word** — Type a space? Denied. Two words? Not on Werd's watch.
- **Complete Formatting** — Bold your word. Italicize it. Make it 72pt. It's the only one — make it count.
- **Comments** — Annotate your word. Write an essay about it, ironically, in the comment field.
- **Dark Mode** — For when your single word needs atmosphere
- **Undo/Redo** — 50 levels of history. 50 words you almost committed to.
- **Auto-Save** — Your word is preserved every 30 seconds. Can't lose the masterpiece.
- **Find & Replace** — Search for your word. It's right there. The only thing there.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is it called Werd?**
A: It's a **W**ord processo**r** for **e**xactly one wor**d**. Also, we didn't want to get sued.

**Q: Can I type more than one word?**
A: No. One document. One word. That's it.

**Q: Can I write a sentence?**
A: No. This is Werd, not Words.

**Q: Is this a joke?**
A: Microsoft Word has been the joke all along. It's called "Word" but accepts "Words". Werd is honest.

**Q: Who hurt you?**
A: Microsoft Word. A thousand features and not one of them stopped me from accidentally changing the formatting of an entire document by pressing Enter.

**Q: Can I use this for actual work?**
A: Yes. Perfect for: passwords, baby names, safe words, one-word movie reviews.

**Q: What's the word count?**
A: Zero or one. Always. Forever. Reliably, consistently, beautifully: at most one.

## The Philosophy

In a world of bloated word processors with millions of features, Werd asks: *"What if one?"*

One word is enough. One word is poetry. One word doesn't need spell check, grammar check, or a 47-tab ribbon interface. One word doesn't accidentally reformat itself when you paste from the internet. One word doesn't crash while auto-saving your 200-page thesis.

One word just *is*.

Microsoft gave us Word. But they lied — it should have been called Words. Werd corrects this injustice.
